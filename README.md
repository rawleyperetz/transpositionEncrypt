Transposition Cipher
This cipher also uses the key and the message in string format as arguments.
Given the string to be 'hello world' with a key of 4, the cipher becomes 'hore llwdlo '
Explaining: after the first value, h, count 4 value places to the right and the yields o and so on.
Easy peasy, eh?
I suck at explaining :)
Apologies.
